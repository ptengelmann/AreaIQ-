        <Section title="1. Acceptance of Terms">
          <p>
            By accessing or using AreaIQ (&quot;the Service&quot;), operated by
            AreaIQ (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, &quot;our&quot;), a
            sole trader registered in the United Kingdom, you agree to these
            Terms of Service. If you do not agree, you must not use the Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of the
            Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms. We
            will notify registered users of material changes via email.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="2. Account Registration">
          <p>
            To use AreaIQ, you must create an account using Google OAuth or email
            and password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality
            of your account credentials and for all activity that occurs under
            your account.
          </p>
          <p>
            You must provide accurate, current information during registration.
            You must be at least 16 years old to create an account. We reserve
            the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms
            or contain false information.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="3. Subscriptions and Payments">
          <p>
            AreaIQ offers web report plans (Free at £0/month for 3 reports,
            Starter at £29/month for 20 reports, Pro at £79/month for 75 reports)
            and API plans (Developer at £49/month for 100 reports, Business at
            £249/month for 500 reports, Growth at £499/month for 1,500 reports).
            Enterprise pricing is available on request. All prices are in GBP and
            inclusive of applicable taxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paid subscriptions are billed monthly through Stripe. By subscribing
            to a paid plan, you authorise us to charge your payment method on a
            recurring basis until you cancel. You can cancel at any time through
            the Stripe billing portal. Cancellation takes effect at the end of
            your current billing period, and you retain access until then.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not offer refunds for partial billing periods. If we change
            pricing, existing subscribers will be notified at least 30 days in
            advance and the new pricing will apply from the next billing cycle.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="4. Usage Limits">
          <p>
            Each plan includes a monthly report credit allowance. Credits reset
            on the 1st of each calendar month. Unused credits do not carry over.
            If you exceed your monthly limit, you will need to upgrade your plan
            to generate additional reports.
          </p>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to implement rate limiting or throttling to
            protect service stability. Automated abuse, including scripted
            requests outside the official API, may result in account suspension.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="5. API Usage">
          <p>
            API access is available on the Developer, Business, and Growth plans. API keys
            are personal to your account and must not be shared or published
            publicly. You are responsible for all usage associated with your API
            keys.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may revoke API keys at any time from your dashboard. We reserve
            the right to revoke API keys that are used in violation of these
            terms, including excessive automated requests or reselling of report
            data.
          </p>
          <p>
            API usage counts towards your monthly report credit allowance. Full
            API documentation is available at{" "}
