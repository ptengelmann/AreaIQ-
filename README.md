# AreaIQ

**Transparent, intent-driven area intelligence for the UK.**

Score any UK location using real government data. No guesswork, no paywalled PDFs, no vague ratings. Just structured intelligence that helps you make better decisions about where to live, invest, or open a business.

**Live at [area-iq.co.uk](https://www.area-iq.co.uk)**

## What it does

Enter a UK postcode or area name, choose your intent (moving, investing, business, or research), and get a fully scored report powered by 5 live government data sources.

Every score is deterministic. AI narrates the results but never generates the numbers.

## What makes it different

- **Deterministic scoring.** 16 scoring functions compute every number from real data using fixed formulas. Same postcode, same scores. Every time.
- **Intent-driven.** "Good for a family" and "good for a restaurant" are completely different questions. The engine weights dimensions differently based on your goal.
- **Context-aware.** A village with one school is well-served. A city with one school is not. The system auto-detects area type (urban, suburban, rural) and benchmarks accordingly.
- **Transparent.** Every score shows the data behind it. No black boxes.

## Data sources

| Source | Data |
|--------|------|
| [Postcodes.io](https://postcodes.io) | Geocoding, LSOA mapping, area classification |
| [Police.uk](https://data.police.uk) | Street-level crime data, categories, trends |
| [IMD 2019](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019) | Deprivation indices across 32,844 LSOAs |
| [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) | Schools, transport, healthcare, shops, parks |
| [Environment Agency](https://environment.data.gov.uk) | Flood risk zones and active warnings |

All data is fetched in real time. No caching, no stale datasets.

## Architecture

```
User input
  → Geocode (Postcodes.io)
  → Fetch data in parallel (5 APIs)
  → Classify area type (urban / suburban / rural)
  → Compute scores (16 deterministic functions, contextual benchmarks)
  → AI narrates the pre-computed scores (Claude Sonnet)
  → Scored report with full transparency
```

The scoring engine (`src/lib/scoring-engine.ts`) contains 16 scoring functions, 4 intent compositions, and 3 area-type benchmark profiles. Scores are enforced server-side after AI generation, so the AI can never override computed values.

## Features

- **Report generation** with real-time data from 5 government APIs
- **Deterministic scoring engine** with 16 functions and 4 intent profiles
- **Area-type benchmarks** (urban, suburban, rural) to eliminate bias
- **Side-by-side comparison** of two areas
- **PDF export** with branded dark design
- **Email report delivery** after generation
- **Social sharing** (WhatsApp, LinkedIn, X, copy link)
- **REST API** with Bearer auth, rate limiting, API key management
- **API usage dashboard** with 30-day request chart
- **Stripe payments** with 4-tier credit-based pricing
- **Admin analytics** with conversion funnels and MRR tracking
- **GDPR-compliant auth** with Google OAuth and email verification
- **Input validation** and sanitisation against injection
- **Error boundaries** with branded terminal-style error pages
- **SEO** with sitemap, robots.txt, JSON-LD structured data, dynamic OG images
- **Onboarding flow** for new users with suggested postcodes
